# ESP32-BLUETOOTH-car with MIT app inventor
## simple robotic car with ESP32 classic BLE board
## Why I made this project!
👉It's a learning basis project\
👉I used ESP32s board in this project which is having in-built bluetooth and wifi support which is is good for compact projects.  
👉After doing robotic car projects with arduino I tried with **esp32 board** which is cool!! and It works fine with me. The aim of this project is how **Esp-32** inbulit bluetooth function works.\
👉This project consists of esp32 board and Mit app inventor with simple code which are availabe in my folder. \
